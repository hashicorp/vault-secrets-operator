# Pull Request: Add IBM Architecture Support (ppc64le and s390x)

## Summary

This pull request adds support for IBM architectures to the Vault Secrets Operator:
- **IBM Power Systems** (ppc64le) 
- **IBM Z mainframes and LinuxONE** (s390x)

## Changes Made

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Updates (`.github/workflows/build.yaml`)
- Added `ppc64le` and `s390x` to build matrices for:
  - Binary builds
  - Docker container builds  
  - UBI (Universal Base Image) container builds

### 2. Release Artifacts Configuration (`.release/vault-secrets-operator-artifacts.hcl`)
- Added binary ZIP archives for ppc64le and s390x
- Added Docker container artifacts for both architectures
- Includes both regular and UBI-based containers

## Benefits

### For IBM Power Systems (ppc64le)
- Native support for IBM POWER9/POWER10 processors
- Enables OpenShift/Kubernetes workloads on IBM Power infrastructure to consume Vault secrets

### For IBM Z/LinuxONE (s390x) 
- Native support for Linux on IBM Z mainframes
- Enables OpenShift/Kubernetes workloads on IBM Power infrastructure to consume Vault secrets

## Technical Details

- **Build Process**: Uses Go's native cross-compilation support
- **Container Support**: Multi-architecture Docker builds using `TARGETOS`/`TARGETARCH`
- **Static Linking**: All binaries are statically linked (no external dependencies)
- **Compatibility**: Maintains full compatibility with existing x86_64 and ARM64 builds

## Testing

### Verified Locally
```bash
# Binary builds tested successfully
make ci-build GOOS=linux GOARCH=ppc64le
make ci-build GOOS=linux GOARCH=s390x

# Outputs:
# dist/linux/ppc64le/vault-secrets-operator (86MB)
# dist/linux/s390x/vault-secrets-operator (90MB)
```

### File Verification
```bash
$ file dist/linux/ppc64le/vault-secrets-operator
ELF 64-bit LSB executable, 64-bit PowerPC, OpenPOWER ELF V2 ABI

$ file dist/linux/s390x/vault-secrets-operator  
ELF 64-bit MSB executable, IBM S/390
```

## Description
This PR adds support for IBM Power (ppc64le) and IBM Z/LinuxONE (s390x) architectures to the Vault Secrets Operator.

## Changes
- ✅ Added ppc64le and s390x to CI/CD build matrices
- ✅ Updated release artifacts to include IBM architectures  
- ✅ Added Docker container support for both architectures
- ✅ Includes both regular and UBI-based images

## Testing
- [x] Local builds verified for both architectures
- [x] Binary compatibility confirmed
- [x] All existing functionality preserved

## Impact
- Enables native deployment on IBM Power Systems
- Supports Linux on IBM Z and LinuxONE environments
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing architectures

```

## Files Changed
- `.github/workflows/build.yaml` - Added IBM architectures to build matrices
- `.release/vault-secrets-operator-artifacts.hcl` - Added release artifacts

## Impact Assessment
- **Risk**: Low - purely additive changes
- **Breaking Changes**: None
- **Backward Compatibility**: Fully maintained
- **Dependencies**: None (uses existing Go toolchain)
