# Vault Secrets Operator Threat Model

The Vault Secrets Operator synchronizes secrets from Vault to [Kubernetes Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). This threat model highlights how using the Vault Secrets Operator affects users' security posture and provides some recommendations for running it securely.

## Executive summary and recommendations for secure use

The Operator occupies a privileged position in a Kubernetes cluster, with unencrypted access to all secrets being synced, and extra care must be taken to secure and monitor it via both Vault and Kubernetes permissions and auditing. In particular:

* Deploy the Operator [in its own dedicated namespace](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso/installation#installation-using-helm), with access limited via RBAC to a small set of operators.
* RBAC permissions must be tightly controlled within each namespace, both for explicit and implicit access to Kubernetes Secrets.
* Enable both Vault and Kubernetes audit logging and monitor for unusual access patterns.
* Configure the Operator to [encrypt the client cache secret contents](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso/helm#v-controller-manager-clientcache-storageencryption) (if enabled) at the application level using the Transit engine.
* Define VaultAuth objects per unit of trust (e.g. an application, or a namespace) with distinct, granular Vault roles and policies to ensure auditability and principle of least privilege.
* Encrypt the Kubernetes etcd database at rest using a KMS provider. Kubernetes Secrets stored in etcd are [not encrypted at rest by default](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/secrets-good-practices/).
* Use TLS negotiated by a well-secured certificate authority for all networked communication, especially for Vault and the Kubernetes API.
* Update the Operator, Vault, and other systems regularly to guard against known vulnerabilities.

## Terminology

* Operator: The Vault Secrets Operator
* Vault: The HashiCorp Vault server(s) with which the Operator communicates
* Cluster: The Kubernetes cluster
* Secret CR: A VaultStaticSecret, VaultDynamicSecret, or VaultPKISecret custom resource that defines a secret to be synced from Vault to a Kubernetes Secret
* Client Cache: The Operator can optionally store Vault tokens and secrets in Kubernetes Secrets to act as a cache and maintain secret leases through Operator restarts and rollouts.

## Scope and limitations

### Scope

* Communication, consumption, and storage of Vault’s secret material within a Kubernetes cluster using the Vault Secrets Operator.

### Limitations

* Securing and configuring Vault and its policies is not considered, and is covered by [Vault’s threat model](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/internals/security).
* Kubernetes is a highly configurable system with many ways to deploy it on-premises and in cloud-hosted environments. The threat model will not go into depth on any one specific mode of deployment, and instead will focus on Kubernetes concepts and primitives that are widely applicable. Instead, refer to the [security documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/) and the [Trail of Bits audit](https://github.com/trailofbits/audit-kubernetes/blob/master/reports/Kubernetes%20Threat%20Model.pdf).
* No secondary effects after disclosing secret material are considered.

## Detailed Description

Full documentation for the Vault Secrets Operator can be found on the [developer website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso).

### Data Flow Diagram

The following is a data flow diagram for the Operator. Nodes in green represent Kubernetes resources that the Operator consumes or creates.

Links in blue represent the flow of secret data:

* The Operator sends Kubernetes service account tokens or other authentication data to Vault, and receives back Vault tokens and Vault secrets.

* The Operator can optionally store and retrieve Vault tokens and secrets in Kubernetes Secrets (the Client Cache) within its own namespace.

* The Operator may request Kubernetes service account tokens or other authentication data (stored in Kubernetes Secrets) from the API Server. It sends Vault secrets to the API Server for storage as Kubernetes Secrets to be used by workload applications.

* The API Server stores and retrieves those Vault secrets as Kubernetes Secrets in etcd.

* Finally, pods can mount Kubernetes Secrets from their own namespace as files in an ephemeral volume or as environment variables. If they have permission, they can also query the Kubernetes Secrets directly from the API Server.

## Threats

The following threats and assets were enumerated while considering several types of attacks that may affect the confidentiality or integrity of secrets synced from Vault:

1. Secret material in transit between Vault, the Operator, and the API server.
1. Secret material at rest in etcd.
1. API access to Operator namespace (privileged service account, Kubernetes Secrets used as cache).
1. Access to Operator pods (in-memory cache secrets, privileged service account).
1. API access to workload namespace (workload Secrets, execing into containers, deploying pods that reference the created secrets).
1. Access to workload secrets mounted into pods (ephemeral volumes, environment variables, in-memory values).
1. Misconfiguration of Kubernetes RBAC and Operator custom resources.

### Threats specific to Kubernetes and Kubernetes Secrets

These threats are included because using Kubernetes Secrets is a fundamental requirement to using the Operator, but their applicability is not affected by whether or not the Secrets are maintained by the Operator. All usages of Kubernetes Secrets should consider the following in their threat model.
